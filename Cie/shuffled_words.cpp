/**
 * You have a sentence with several words with spaces removed and words having
 * their character order shuffled. You have a dictionary. Write a function to
 * produce the sentence back with spaces at the right locations.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * If: dictionary = ['fox', 'quick', 'the', 'brown'], input =
 * "ehtkuqciborwnxof", then the expected sentence is: "the quick brown fox".

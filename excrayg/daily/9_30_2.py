#13. 9 - Let A and Q be arrays of strings. Define subarray A[i:j] to cover Q if for all k belongs to [Q, n_q-1], where n_q is length of Q, there exists l belongs [i,j], Q[k] = A[l]
#Write a function that takes two arryas A and Q and computes a minimum length subarray A[i:j] that covers Q. 
# Suppose A is presented in streaming fashopn and Q can be stored in RAM.

# first:
# Given a number n, write the number of ways of using 1,5,10,25 to add up to n.
# e.g.: given 1, there's only one way [[1]]; given 5 there's two way: [[5], [1,1,1,1,1]]
# given 10, there's four way: [[10], [5,5], [5,1,1,1,1,1], [1,1,...1]]


# second:
# A pole of infinite length is planted vertically on the ground. 
# A stone is placed at a distance of 'd1' meters from the pole towards the right.
# A bird is sitting on the ground exactly in the middle of the pole and stone. 
# The bird flies away towards the right in such a manner that its distance from the pole and the distance between the bird and the stone at any point of time is always equal.
# Calculate the distance between the bird and it's starting point after n seconds if the bird is covering 'd2'metres horizontally every second.
# the state of the function is like: double cal(int d1, int d2, int n); you can assume d1 > 0, d2 > 0, n > 0


# third:
# given two linked list, return their first common node. if not exists, return NULL.
